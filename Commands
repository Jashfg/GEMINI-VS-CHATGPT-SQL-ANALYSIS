#1)What are the average scores for each capability on both the Gemini Ultra and GPT-4 models?
select capabilityname  ,round( avg(scoregemini) )as avg_scoregemini , round(avg(scoregpt4)) as avg_scoregpt from capabilities
inner join Benchmarks
on
Capabilities.Capabilityid=Benchmarks.Capabilityid
group by capabilityname;

#2)Which benchmarks does Gemini Ultra outperform GPT-4 in terms of scores?
select benchmarkname from Benchmarks
where scoregemini > scoregpt4;

#3)What are the highest scores achieved by Gemini Ultra and GPT-4 for each benchmark in the Image capability?
select   benchmarkname , max(scoregemini) as max_gemini , max(scoregpt4) as max_gpt4 
from  Benchmarks
where capabilityid=5
group by benchmarkname;

#4)Calculate the percentage improvement of Gemini Ultra over GPT-4 for each benchmark?
select  benchmarkname , round(((scoregemini-scoregpt4)/scoregpt4*100),0) as percentage_improvement from Benchmarks
where scoregpt4 is not null
order by percentage_improvement ;

#5)Retrieve the benchmarks where both models scored above the average for their respective models?
select benchmarkname ,scoregemini,scoregpt4  from Benchmarks
where scoregemini >(select avg(scoregemini)   from Benchmarks)
and  scoregpt4>(select avg(scoregpt4) from Benchmarks);

#8) Retrieve the rankings for each capability based on Gemini Ultra scores?
select capabilityname , scoregemini , DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY scoregemini  DESC) as rnk from Capabilities
inner join Benchmarks
on
Capabilities.capabilityid=Benchmarks.capabilityid;

#9)Convert the Capability and Benchmark names to uppercase?
select upper(capabilityname) as capability_name  , upper(benchmarkname) as benchmark_name  from Capabilities
inner join Benchmarks
on  
Capabilities.capabilityid=Benchmarks.capabilityid;

#10) Can you provide the benchmarks along with their descriptions in a concatenated format?
select concat(benchmarkname ," " , description ) as benchmarkname 
from benchmarks;
